  Entity and association taxonomy and datamodel for computer-science abstractions. Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself. As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and software.

  ontology class:
    mixin: true
    description: >-
      a concept or class in an ontology, vocabulary or thesaurus. Note that nodes in
      a zzz compatible KG can be considered both instances of zzz classes, and
      OWL classes in their own right. In general you should not need to use this class directly.
      Instead, use the appropriate zzz class, i.e. cso:ComputationalProcess
    exact_mappings:
      - owl:Class
      - schema:Class
    comments:
      - >-
         This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a
         node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative csoloink category, such as DeploymentEntity
      - >-
         Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in the graph,
         but can be the object of 'type' edges.
